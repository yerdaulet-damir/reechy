## 🤔 The Pitch

We love Loom, but we wanted something open-source, wildly faster, and built specifically for **fast pitch videos**. We didn't want to record a video, download it, open CapCut to trim the bad takes, and then upload it somewhere else just to send it to a client.

Reechy solves this. It's a blazing-fast, open-source video infrastructure that runs entirely in your browser. Record, trim, and generate a beautiful pitch page in seconds.

## ✨ Why It's a Beast

- **🎥 Loom, but Open-Source:** Studio-quality webcam and microphone recording directly in the browser. No installs. Zero watermarks.
- **✂️ CapCut-style Editor:** A built-in, frictionless video editor. Trim your recordings, adjust start/end points, and polish bad takes instantly.
- **📄 Instant Pitch Pages:** Automatically generate a beautiful sharing page with custom headlines, agendas, and a Calendly booking link.
- **📝 Beast Teleprompter:** A floating, controllable teleprompter paired with accurate timecode logging so you never forget your script.
- **🎨 Custom Camera Layouts:** Fully customizable PiP (Picture-in-Picture) frames, cinematic filters, and layout modes.
- **⚡ Next.js & Turbopack:** Blazing fast performance backed by React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Shadcn UI.
